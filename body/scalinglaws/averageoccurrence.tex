\paragraph{Average versus occurrence}\mbox{}\\
Another interesting analysis can be the study of the relationship between the occurrence and the expression average. In figure~\ref{fig:scalinglaws/gtex/meanDiff_binned_sampling} the result is shown: it is clear that there is a relationship between occurrence and average, genes that express in more realizations (higher occurrence and right in the figure) have a higher average. Moreover, there aren't genes that have high expression in few realizations; rare genes are also difficult to find so have a small average. Note that the average has got a bound because counts are integer numbers, so if, for example, one gene express in $n$ of the $R$ samples, it has occurrence $O_i=\frac{n}{R}$ and its average can't be lower than $\avg{\mathrm{counts}}=\frac{1*n}{R}$
