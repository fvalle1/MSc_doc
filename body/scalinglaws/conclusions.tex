\paragraph{In conclusion} the study of gene expression across samples reveals interesting facts. Coding and non-coding genes have different behaviours. Null model isn't, again, enough to explain the data the revealed themselves as more variable than expected.

Analysis described in this chapter will be useful in the next part of the work, in fact empower the possibility to define a gene selection to isolate highly variable genes if necessary.
