\paragraph{In conclusion} the study of gene expression across samples reveals interesting facts. Coding and non-coding genes have different behaviours. The null model isn't, again, enough to explain the data. Real data genes revealed themselves as more variable than expected.

The analyses described in this chapter will be useful in the next part of the work: in fact, they empower the possibility to define a gene selection model to isolate highly variable genes if necessary.
