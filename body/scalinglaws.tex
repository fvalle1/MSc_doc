\chapter{Scaling laws}\label{ch:scalinglaws}
One of the goals of this work is to search, reveal, study and use universal laws in bulk gene expression data~\nocite{altmann2016statistical}.
As in chapter~\ref{ch:structure} approaches from different field of science are considered at this point.

In can be interesting to study the behaviour of the gene expression across samples.

\section{Scaling}
\draft{gene expression across samples? gamma?}

Given a matrix of components and realisations as~\ref{fig:componetstable} with expression entries $n_{i j}$ it is possible to estimate the mean of a row $m_i=\avg{n_{i
 j}}_j$ and its variance $\var{i}=\avg{n_{i j}^2}_j - \avg{n_{i j}}^2_j$.

\paragraph{$<FPKM>$ normalisation}
One can be interested in finding genes that are expressed often, and what is the
average expression of them.
To manage this it is plotted the average expression $<FPKM>$ versus the number
of samples in which that gene is expressed that is, considering the thresholds~\ref{sec:threshold},
$\Sigma_j\theta (FPKM_{ij}-0,1)\theta (10^5-FPKM_{ij})$

\subsection{Average versus occurrence}
Another interesting analysis can be the relation between the occurrence and the average. In figure~\ref{fig:scalelaws/gtex/meanDiff_binned_sampling} it is shown the re
sult, it is clear that there is a relation between occurrence and average, genes that express in more realisations (higher occurrence and right in the figure) have an
higher average. Moreover doesn't exist genes that have high expression in few realisations; genes that are rare are also difficult to find so have a small average. Not
e that the average has got a bound due to the fact that counts are integer numbers, so if, for example, one gene express in $n$ of the $R$ samples, it has occurrence $
O_i=\frac{n}{R}$ and its average is at least $\avg{\mathrm{counts}}=\frac{1*n}{R}$
