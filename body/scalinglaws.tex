\chapter{Scaling laws}\label{ch:scalinglaws}
One of the goals of this work is to search, reveal, study and use universal laws in bulk gene expression data. Approaches from different field of science are considered at this point, as already done in chapter~\ref{ch:structure}.~\nocite{altmann2016statistical}

In can be interesting to study how the gene expression changes and behave across all the samples.

Given a matrix of components and realizations as~\ref{fig:componetstable} with expression entries $n_{i j}$ it all begins selecting a row and estimate its mean $m_i=\avg{n_{i
 j}}_j$ and its variance $\var{i}=\avg{n_{i j}^2}_j - \avg{n_{i j}}^2_j$. A row is nothing but a component that, in the data considered in this work, is represented by a gene. At this point, the analyses consider raw counts as entries.
